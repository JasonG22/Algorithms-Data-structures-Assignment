# Algorithms-Data-structures-Assignment
Implemented DFS, BFS, Prim’s MST, and Dijkstra’s SPT in Java using adjacency lists. The program reads graphs from files and outputs algorithm progress step by step. Tested on a Dublin road network with cycles and multiple paths, it highlights efficient heap usage, graph traversal strategies, and algorithm correctness.
